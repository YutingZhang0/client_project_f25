      Artificial intelligence is becoming a valuable tool for career development. With well-crafted prompts, you can generate draft resumes, cover letters, or interview practice questions. However, it’s important to approach AI as a partner, not a replacement—your critical thinking, editing, and authenticity are still essential. The <em>AI Prompt Resource Guide</em> provides concrete examples of prompts you can adapt for your own career journey, from brainstorming resume bullet points to preparing for behavioral interviews.

       Alumni provide a powerful window into what life after UMSI looks like. 
       By listening to panels and personal stories, you can learn how graduates 
       navigated their own uncertainties, built networks, and leveraged UMSI skills 
       in diverse industries. These recordings highlight real career trajectories—both 
       linear and unconventional—and offer practical advice for students considering 
       similar paths. Use them to gain perspective and generate questions for your own 
       informational interviews. Below, we have listed resources related to different 
       tracks, hoping to provide helpful guidance for everyone.

    <h2>Planning Your Job and Internship Search</h2>

    <p>
      Searching for jobs or internships is most effective when you treat it as a structured project.
       Instead of sporadically browsing postings, plan your search like a class assignment: 
       set milestones, keep a spreadsheet of applications, and track deadlines. 
       This approach reduces stress, helps you notice patterns in job descriptions, 
       and ensures you don't miss opportunities. UMSI provides a planning spreadsheet 
       to help you organize target roles, companies, and timelines—making the process 
       more intentional and less overwhelming.

    <p>
      Part-time work can provide both financial support and career-relevant experience while you study. Many UMSI students find roles on campus, in Ann Arbor, or through remote opportunities. These positions help you strengthen transferable skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. The key is to balance work commitments with your academic responsibilities and professional goals. The CDO maintains resources to help you evaluate whether part-time work is right for you and to find postings that match your skills and schedule.
